\years{2022--present}\textbf{Visiting Professor, \href{https://ut.ee/en}{University of Tartu}, Institute of Computer Science}\\
Research, development, and delivery of curriculum to teach the fundamentals of AI, data science, and large language models such as ChatGPT to graduate students and faculty. 

\years{2022--present}\textbf{Chief Executive Officer, \href{https://onefact.org}{One Fact Foundation}}\\
Founded a 501(c)(3) non-profit to scale the AI models I have developed to improve health care: raised \$350,000+ in institutional grants and backing from institutions including the NIH, Columbia, Stanford, and UPenn. Built a team of 20+ contributors. Awarded grants from the NIH to train faculty from 50+ medical schools in artificial intelligence algorithms for health care, and contracts from UPenn and Princeton to develop and deliver courses on AI. Collected data from 4,000+ hospitals to build \href{https://www.payless.health/}{Payless Health}. Trained a health fund analytics team to use our open source tools to allocate their \$1B+ spending and create incentives for their 200,000+ members that steer employees toward low-cost, high-quality health care. 

\years{2023--2024}\textbf{Lead Machine Learning Research Scientist, \href{https://pharehealth.com}{Phare Health Limited}}, London, England\\
